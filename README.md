# Universe
*Universe* makes tens to hundreds billion of procedurally generated suns, planets and moons in a virtually unlimited number of persistent galaxies.

- Celestial bodies are generated according to latest astronomical discoveries
- Covers physical characteristics, orbital parameters and spin parameters
- The *state vector* of each planet and moon is dynamic, meaning that it changes in real time
- Galaxies are generated in 2D (meaning that celestial bodies have no inclination)

This code provides a front-end REST API to the back-end serverless generator, locared in *Azure function* and *Amazon lambda*.
The code also manages caching, billing and throttling.

## Access key
If you wish to use this galaxy generator, you will need an purchase an access key from **freevariable** to cover at least your **pay-per-use** usage of the serverless backend.

As of now, *Universe* pricing is aligned with Azure functions: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/functions/
