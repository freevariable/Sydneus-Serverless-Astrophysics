# Universe
*Universe* makes tens to hundreds billion of procedurally generated suns, planets and moons in a virtually unlimited number of persistent galaxies.

- Celestial bodies are generated according to latest astronomical discoveries
- Covers physical characteristics, orbital parameters and spin parameters
- The *state vector* of each planet and moon is dynamic, meaning that it changes in real time
- Galaxies are generated in 2D (meaning that celestial bodies have no inclination)

This code provides a front-end REST API to the back-end serverless generator, locared in Azure functions and Amazon lambdas.
The code also manages caching, billing and throttling.
